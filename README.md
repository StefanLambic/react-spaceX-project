# More Info About The Project
- This project has been made using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React. 
- The project consists of a main page with form, where an user can search up the desired spaceX mission name, and with that the results will be displayed on the screen, consisting of mission image, mission name, launch date, details and the information if the mission was successful of failed (true or false). If an user enter invalid path, it will lead to an ERROR page, which was made possible by using router. 
- In this project i have practiced my skills working with API's and router.
